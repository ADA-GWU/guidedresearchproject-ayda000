So far added new code. Will add more updates here.
I finalized and made any adjustments to my code as needed.
I also finalized all the visulations I will use.
I created a draft powerpoint for my presentaion.

These statistics that I describe below provide an overview of the sentiment index, showing its central tendency, variability, and the range of sentiment values observed. 
Below is a description and statistical summary of the FOMC Sentiment Index: 

Count: This is the  number of data points in the FOMC Sentiment Index. In this case, there are 202 data points.

Mean: This is the average sentiment score of the FOMC Sentiment Index.
It indicates the overall sentiment tendency. In this case for my research, the mean sentiment score is approximately -0.002320.

Std: This is the standard deviation of the sentiment scores. It measures the dispersion or spread of the sentiment data points around the mean. 
In this case for my research, the standard deviation is approximately 0.195040.

Min: This is the minimum sentiment score observed in the FOMC Sentiment Index. It represents the most negative sentiment value. 
In this case for my research, the minimum sentiment score is approximately -0.521709.

25% Quartile 1: This is the first quartile or 25th percentile of the sentiment scores. It represents the value below which 25% of the data points lie.
In this case for my research, the first quartile is approximately -0.139679.

50% Quartile 2: This is the second quartile/median of the sentiment scores. It represents the value below which 50% of the data points lie. 
In this case for my research, the median sentiment score is approximately -0.020916.

75% Quartile 2: This is the third quartile or 75th percentile of the sentiment scores. It represents the value below which 75% of the data points lie.
In this case for my research, the third quartile is approximately 0.116388.

Max: This is the maximum sentiment score observed in the FOMC Sentiment Index. It represents the most positive sentiment value.
In this case for my research, the maximum sentiment score is approximately 0.456939.

To link the FOMC Sentiment Index (FOMC-SI) to key economic variables such as GDP growth and stock market performance measures, I can use regression analysis. 
Regression analysis allows for me to examine the relationship between the FOMC-SI (independent variable) and the economic variables (dependent variables) 
to understand how changes in sentiment may impact economic indicators.

Research Innovation:
Conducting sentiment analysis specifically on FOMC speeches as there is no existing research project in this domain.  
Creating a historical index of FOMC sentiment based on aggregated sentiment scores
The FOMC index can serve as a tool for assessing the overall sentiment of FOMC members and provide a comprehensive view of sentiment trends over time. 
This can allow for potentially revealing patterns related to economic conditions and policy decisions.
Investigating the relationship between the FOMC-SI and key economic variables, such as GDP growth and stock market performance, through regression analysis.
Applying sentiment analysis to study the link between FOMC sentiment and financial market conditions. 


Also i decided for futire work I would like to create a sentiment analysis model trained on more relevant financial text.
Training a domain-specific sentiment analysis model using financial data can potentially lead to more accurate and contextually relevant sentiment predictions
for financial documents like FOMC speeches, economic reports, company earnings calls, news articles, and social media posts related to the financial market.

This will allow for a more accurate and contextually meaningful sentiment analysis tool for financial applications.





In additon, I analyzed the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL).
This helped me further interpret and analze my results. Also helped me to examine correlations between the sentiment index and other financial market indicators.
