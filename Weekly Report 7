So far added new code. Will add more updates here.
I finalized and made any adjustments to my code as needed.
I also finalized all the visulations I will use.
I created a draft powerpoint for my presentaion.

In additon, I analyzed the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL).
This helped me further interpret and analze my results. Also helped me to examine correlations between the sentiment index and other financial market indicators.
