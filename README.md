Project Purpose

This project aims first, to develop a sentiment index for the statements made by the chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings; and second, to explore if such a sentiment index can be useful in predicting financial market conditions. 

This research project builds an index that measures the overall sentiments in one of the most important US economic policy institutions, namely the FOMC meeting statements by implementing a state-of-the art Large Language Model (LLM), namely FinBERT. This index is named the FOMC Sentiment Index (FOMC-SI). FOMC-SI will be used to investigate if the overall sentiment in the FOMC meeting statements can predict economic or market conditions.
