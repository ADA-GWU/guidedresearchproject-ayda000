I am considering a Time Series Plot of Sentiment Index and Heatmap of Sentiment over Time for data visualization as described below.

Time Series Plot of Sentiment Index: This can be used because I am creating a historical sentiment index. This can show how sentiment changes over time. 
The x-axis can represent time (from 2000 to present), and the y-axis can represent the sentiment index. Each point on the graph represents the average sentiment value of each FOMC statement. 

Heatmap of Sentiment over Time: A heatmap can help me  show the sentiment of each FOMC meeting over the course of a year. 
The x-axis could represent months, the y-axis could represent years from 2000 to present. Finally, the color could represent sentiment with a gradient from negative to positive.

I am in the process of using FinBERT. FinBERT is a financial sentiment analysis model based on the BERT model developed by Google. 
The purpose of FinBERT is to analyze financial text data and provide sentiment labels such as positive, negative, or neutral. Below iss the general process of how I will use FinBERT for sentiment analysis on my data. 

I have the necessary packages installed such as PyTorch. 
I will load the FinBERT model using the transformers library. You need the name of the model if it is a public model, or the path to the model if it is a local model.


I will use sentiment analysis on the preprocessed data. I will feed the preprocessed data to the model and get the output. 
The final output will be a sentiment label such as positive, negative, or neutral. This label represents the sentiment of the input text according to the model. 
Also the sentiment is in the context of financial data, so a positive sentiment indicates positive financial implications.
